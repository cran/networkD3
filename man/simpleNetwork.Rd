\title{Function for creating simple D3 JavaScript force directed network graphs.}
\source{
D3.js was created by Michael Bostock. See \url{http://d3js.org/} and,
  more specifically for directed networks
  \url{https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/API.md#forces-d3-force}
}
\usage{
simpleNetwork(Data, Source = 1, Target = 2, height = NULL, width = NULL,
  linkDistance = 50, charge = -30, fontSize = 7, fontFamily = "serif",
  linkColour = "#666", nodeColour = "#3182bd", opacity = 0.6, zoom = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{a data frame object with three columns. The first two are the
names of the linked units. The third records an edge value. (Currently the
third column doesn't affect the graph.)}

\item{Source}{character string naming the network source variable in the data
frame. If \code{Source = NULL} then the first column of the data frame is
treated as the source.}

\item{Target}{character string naming the network target variable in the data
frame. If \code{Target = NULL} then the second column of the data frame is
treated as the target.}

\item{height}{height for the network graph's frame area in pixels (if
\code{NULL} then height is automatically determined based on context)}

\item{width}{numeric width for the network graph's frame area in pixels (if
\code{NULL} then width is automatically determined based on context)}

\item{linkDistance}{numeric distance between the links in pixels (actually
arbitrary relative to the diagram's size).}

\item{charge}{numeric value indicating either the strength of the node
repulsion (negative value) or attraction (positive value).}

\item{fontSize}{numeric font size in pixels for the node text labels.}

\item{fontFamily}{font family for the node text labels.}

\item{linkColour}{character string specifying the colour you want the link
lines to be. Multiple formats supported (e.g. hexadecimal).}

\item{nodeColour}{character string specifying the colour you want the node
circles to be. Multiple formats supported (e.g. hexadecimal).}

\item{opacity}{numeric value of the proportion opaque you would like the
graph elements to be.}

\item{zoom}{logical value to enable (\code{TRUE}) or disable (\code{FALSE})
zooming}
